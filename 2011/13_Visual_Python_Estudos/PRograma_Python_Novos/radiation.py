# This program visualizes the radiative E and B fields of a charged particle
# receiving a brief acceleration. Before the acceleration, the particle was
# stationary. After the acceleration, the particle moves with constant
# momentum although this motion is not shown. For obvious reasons, the
# outgoing pulse will have already propagated a finite distance from the
# particle when the simulation starts.
#
# Joe Heafner, April 2003
#
# Future modifications:
#  1) show Poynting vector
#  2) click the mouse to stop and start propagation
#  3) show the radial field inside and/or outside the spherical wavefront
#  4) allow the particle to oscillate
#
